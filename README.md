# ShadowFox Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains my work during the Data Science internship at ShadowFox, covering three key projects focused on data analysis, visualization, and comparative tool evaluation.

## üìÇ Tasks Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Matplotlib vs. Plotly Guide**  
**Objective:** Compare Python's two major visualization libraries.  
**Key Features:**  
- Side-by-side code examples for 5+ graph types  
- Use-case recommendations (static vs. interactive)  
- Performance and customization trade-offs  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Delhi AQI Analysis**   
**Objective:** Analyze air quality trends in Delhi using PM2.5 and PM10 data.  
**Key Features:**  
- Data preprocessing (datetime conversion, seasonal categorization)  
- AQI classification based on CPCB standards  
- Visualizations:  
  - Time-series trends (Matplotlib/Seaborn)  
  - Seasonal box plots  
  - Correlation heatmaps  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales Data Analysis**  
**Objective:** Investigate how manufacturing and freight costs impact profitability.  
**Key Features:**  
- Synthetic sales dataset generation  
- Time-series analysis of gross/net sales vs. costs  
- Correlation heatmap of financial metrics  
- Fiscal year-wise trend visualizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas datetime operations, feature engineering  

## üìù Key Insights
**AQI Analysis**: Winter shows the highest PM2.5 levels in Delhi.

**Sales Data**: Manufacturing costs have stronger profit correlation (-0.71) than freight costs.

**Viz Tools**: Plotly excels in interactivity; Matplotlib offers finer control for static plots.
